So I've spent some time getting serious about writing scripts for Textual IRC.  These are mainly in AppleScript with other languages pinched in here and there.

Drop these scripts in your `~/Library/Application Support/Textual IRC/Scripts` folder and let the fireworks begin!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/phracker/textual-scripts ~/Library/Application\ Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual/textual-scripts
$ mv ~/Library/Application\ Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual/textual-scripts/* ~/Library/Application\ Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual/
```

`/scc` will autojoin their IRC chans without using the web dialog, you just need to fill in your cookie info.

`/spot` is a custom spotify script for your hacking pleasure.

`/whatup` checks the status of what.cd's site, tracker, and irc network.
